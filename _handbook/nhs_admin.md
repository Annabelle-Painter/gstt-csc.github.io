All new members of the CSC team will complete a Trust Induction. Each member will be provided with a GSTT account 
and corresponding (@gstt.nhs.uk) email address. This will give you access to the Trust's intranet and services including 
the HR Portal, Service-Now Portal (for IT support) and TrustOLE for completing mandatory training and educational courses.

**PDRs**

Each member of the CSC Team undergoes a Performance Development Review (PDR) each year with their Line Manager. This is 
an opportunity for members of the team to set personal development goals and objectives, reflect on their development 
and learning from the previous 12 months and highlight any outstanding areas where additional education and/or support 
may be required. This is also an opportunity to discuss your career progression, health and well-being concerns or 
changes in working hours.

More information about the PDR process can be found on the Trust HR Portal.
