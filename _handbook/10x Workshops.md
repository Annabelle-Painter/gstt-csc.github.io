On alternate Wednesdays the CSC Team hosts a 10x workshop. Within this space we discuss new topics surrounding the implementation of AI within the Healthcare sector, we have group discussions about the current practices, new ideas and policies that effect the NHS and AI Technologies. 
<br>The 10x sessions are also an opportunity for the team to present their projects to the wider team as well as external parties who have expressed an interest in our work. 
<br>We have regular Retrospective exercises for members of the group to express what has been a positive experience over the last quarter, what barriers or delays they have experienced. We conclude these sessions with actions focused on improving our workflow and practice moving forward.
