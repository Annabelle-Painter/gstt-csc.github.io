[XNAT](https://xnat.org/) is an open source imaging informatics platform capable of storing and managing medical images and associated data. Developed by the Neuroinformatics Research Group at Washington University, XNAT can be used to support a wide range of imaging-based projects.

Data is ingested from the Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS), the industry-standard storage system for different medical imaging types, into XNAT where it is anonymised (or more accurately, de-identified) and sorted into relevant projects, which ensures the data:

- Is only visible to those who need it
- Can be deleted upon project completion
- Is compliant with the [DICOM Standards Supplement 142](https://www.dicomstandard.org/News-dir/ftsup/docs/sups/sup142.pdf)

Within Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT), XNAT forms a part of the local secure enclave for the purpose of [federated learning in artificial intelligence projects](../platforms/flip.html).
