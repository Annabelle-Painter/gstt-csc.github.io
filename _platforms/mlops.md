MLOps is a framework for the development of AI models in a healthcare setting. The application development framework has three major components:

- **MLOps server** 
  > Hosts the machine learning (ML) lifecycle management services.
- **Project template**
  > The starting point for any project using this development framework.
- **```csc-mlops``` package**
  > Available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/csc-mlops/) and is installed by default by the project template, this handles communication between the project and server, performs automated tasks, and includes helper functions and classes to streamline development.

These components work together to simplify and automate many of the processes required for controlled app development.
