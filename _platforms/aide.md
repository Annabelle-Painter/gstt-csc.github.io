AIDE, the AI Deployment Engine, is an intelligent tool that allows healthcare providers to deploy AI models safely, 
effectively, and efficiently by enabling the integration of AI models into clinical workflows.

One of the unique features of AIDE is that it was designed by the community, for the community, and will be released 
as open-source. AIDE is a comprehensive system, encompassing administrative and clinical tasks as well as regulatory 
compliance.

AIDE provides opportunities for data scientists to deploy applications in hospital settings and in September 2021 the 
first instance of AIDE went live at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, with a stroke AI tool to support 
NHS clinicians to help improve direct patient care.
