First, make sure that your project falls under 'service development' and not 'research' by checking http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/. Then, make sure the clinical lead is happy to be added as a collaborator on the QIPS system. Once you're sure of both, proceed to step 1.

All AI projects must be registered with the Trust Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Team as a service evaluation/clinical audit on the Trust database [here](http://tww-wafr/WAFR-FAD/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/WAFR-FAD/Applications/ClinicalAuditV2/Default.aspx ).

1. Log in with your existing Trust credentials.  

2. Select ‘create new proposal’ tab. 
3. Proposal type is ‘service evaluation’ 
4. Type in the project title as agreed with radiologists 
5. Add the clinical lead as the proposer.  
6. Add your telephone number. 
7. Select ‘no’ for ‘is proposal trust wide’ 
8. For lead speciality, select ‘medical physics’ 
9. For ‘responsible person’, type in your own name 
10. For ‘reasons for carrying out this project, select ‘high risk service’, ‘of local concern’, ‘identified as a problem’ and / or ‘quality improvement’ and any other that may apply. 
11. For ‘objective’, briefly explain what we are trying to achieve with this project. 
12. Click ‘save’, then press ‘next’.
13. For ‘stakeholder’ write ‘radiologists’, select all activities they will be involved with and press the green plus button. 
14. If the project does not involve patients or carers, select ‘no’, else select 'yes'. 
15. For population, describe who will be included, e.g. ‘all chest CT’, and who will be excluded (if any). 
16. For population or sample, select all that apply as they apply, choosing to gather data from 1/1 of last year to 31/1 of last year. Select data collection strategy (e.g. retrospective) and the data sources (e. g. patient records). 
17. Click ‘save’, then press ‘next’.
18. Click on ‘add measures’. A pop-up will appear.  
19. Set the standard or acceptable level of compliance (frequently '100%' but write whatever is appropriate for your project)  
20. Describe the evidence of quality of care or service – how will we know whether the AI is working? Example evidence: ‘lung nodule in chest CT is correctly reported in report’ 
21. There are ‘no’ exception. 
22. The data collection instructions should describe how data will be acquired, e.g. ‘studies to be exported from PACS and processed ‘offline’’. 
23. Click ‘Add measures’. 
24. Fill in the target dates, e.g. for data collection (1 month from start), findings to be reviewed by 3 months from the data collection date, report to be submitted 3 months from the findings date. 
25. Click ‘save’, click ‘next’.
26. Select all boxes which apply. This is likely to be all boxes. 
27. Click ‘next’. 
28. Agree with the declaration by ticking the box and click on ‘next’. Click on submit. 

The proposal will be sent to the Specialty QI & Audit lead for approval and then to the Directorate QI & Audit lead. Once approved you will be notified by email.
