summary: An AI tool to convert MRI images in to motion correct 3D images.
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Tom.html">Tom</a>
modality: MRI's 
pathology:
rationale: This AI model converts MRI images into full motion-corrected 3-dimensional images, which negates the need for manual intervention by a radiographer or clinician.
