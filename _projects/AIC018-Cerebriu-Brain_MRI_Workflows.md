title: Protocol application for Brain MRI 
status: Governance

summary: Evaluation of brian MRI smart protocoling software.
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Laurence.html">Laurence</a>
modality: MRI's
pathology: Neurology
rationale: A consequence of the ever-increasing demand for diagnostic MR imaging is additional workload and stress placed on MRI departments. MR Departments need to operaate as efficiently as possible. A a smart protocoling application for brain MRI has the potential to improve brain MRI efficiency, improve patient prioritisation, reduce scan time, re-examinations, and non-acute admission
patient-pathway: Patients who present tot heir GP with diffuse neurological symptoms (headaches, dizziness) are referred to GSTT for a Brian MRI. In the current pathway patients would attend for the MRI appointment where a radiologist will review the images. If an infarct is spotted the radiologist has to re-call the patient, to visit the hospital again for additional MRI sequence scans. With a smart protocol toll in place the infact can be highlighted to the radiologist in real time and addtional scans can be completed in the same appointment slot.   
training-data: A commercial product is being evaluated
errors: 
goals: Retrospective measure of diagnostic accuracy. Prospective evaluation of performance and value added. Record correlation between existing pathway and Cerebriu recommended protocols.
success-criteria: Real-time adaptation of MR scanning protocols for the right sequences at the right time.

A consequence of the ever-increasing demand for diagnostic MR imaging is additional workload and stress placed on MRI departments. MR Departments need to operaate as efficiently as possible. A smart protocoling application for brain MRI's has the potential to improve the efficiency of the service and improve patient prioritisation. This application may also reduce scan time, re-examinations rates, and non-acute admission to ward environments.
