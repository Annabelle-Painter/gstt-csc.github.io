The Project Board below tracks the progress of each CSC project through the different 
phases of the software developmental lifecycle. 

These stages are:
- **Backlog**: These projects have not been started, this can be due to lack of project owner engagement, the requirement for additional information from the project owners team, the project idea not aligning with the CSC Teams mission, or the CSC Team not having capacity to support the project submitted at the time of receiving the proposal .
- **Scoping**: Initial conversations with the projects team and project stakeholders are being completed. Design and development ideas are being planned and validation, verification and evaluation methods are being discussed.  
- **Documenting**: Final project plans are documented and circulate to all members of the project teams. For work being completed with SME's compliance documents for Information Security (IS) and Information Governance (IG) teams are being completed.
- **Governance**: For evaluation projects with SME's the submission of IG and IS documents has been completed and feedback or approval is being generated from these teams.
- **Contracting**: For evaluation projects with SME's, Pilot Agreement documents are being completed and Data Processing Agreements are being executed. 
- **Data Curating**: Projects teams are now accessing their pre-defined data sets for either Machine Leaning (ML) algorithm training or in preparation for retrospective evaluation.
- **Developing**: The data acquired is now being used to develop ML algorithms. This stage will also include, validation and verification testing. Evaluation of SME products will by-pass this development stage.
- **Evaluating**: The evaluation phase comprises of two parts; 
<br> 1) Retrospective evaluation- Where retrospective data is passed through the SME software of the developed AI. The output of this phase will determine if further development is required or if the software is ready to be implemented into practice as a supporting tool. 
<br>2) Prospective evaluation- The AI is ready to be used in a live clinical setting and evaluated in the clinical setting it was designed for. 
  <br> For both parts an evaluation plan will be designed and completed for a set time frames and performance data will be collected alongside end user feedback where applicable. 
- **Reporting**: At the end of the evaluation phase a final report will be generated to present to the Product owner. This report will highlight if additional design and development cycles need to be completed. For evaluation work with SME's this report will form the base for product owners to submit applications to the Trust procurement team.
- **Graveyard**: These projects have not been successful in one of the above workflow stages. Therefore, they have not continued through the project pathway nd have been terminated.
