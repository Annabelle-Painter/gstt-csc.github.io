If what we do sounds exciting, get involved and work with us! There are several ways to do so:

### Temporarily
There are several options available as part of the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP), which allows trainees to allocate part of the programme time to working with us. We've summarised the options and the different timeframes below but for more information, please refer to our dedicated [STP page](../stp.html). 

{% include progress-stp.html %}

Alternatively, you can apply to join as a Clinical Fellow.

### Permanently

### Projects
This could be:
- An existing or proposed new project that aims to resolve a clinical need
- An existing or proposed new project requiring or expected to require evaluation
- A new medical device to be built under our Quality Management System (QMS)
- Contributing to an existing CSC project (see our Projects page [here](../ourwork.html) for more information)
