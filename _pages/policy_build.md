# Building SaMD - Medical Device Software Development


## The CSC Team builds Medical software that is deployed within the GSTT Trust.

<p style=”text-align:center;”> The CSC Team builds Medical software that is deployed within the GSTT Trust.</p>

<br>
<br>

The CSC department develops software applications to be used within a clinical setting, which includes Software as a 
Medical Device (SaMD). It is well understood that building medical software requires extra safety considerations above 
normal software development.

## Regulation 

---
<br>

###  UK MDR 2002


UK-MDR 2002 is the current applicable regulation for medical devices within the UK. It encodes MDR 2002 into law, with
requirements for companies to have a uk-based responsible person. UK MDR 2002 is applicable to applications developed
by the CSC as they will be deployed into clinical use. The software we build includes AI applications that we intend to 
deploy on the AIDE platform, or as stand alone medical devices. 

Although the CSC does not initially intend to put the software we create onto the UK market, we still work within a 
quality management system that is ISO 13485:2016 compliant to ensure best practises when developing SaMD.

Link:  <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html"> BS EN 62304</a>

This standard provide a framework for developing medical software, which relies on working within a ISO 13485 quality management system. 
Key points include:
- Maintaining good traceability of meeting customer requirements
- Enforcing clinical safety
- Classification of the software (A/B/C)
- Modularity for verification/unit testing
- Change management
