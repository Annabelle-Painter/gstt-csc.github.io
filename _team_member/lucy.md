### Bio
Lucy started working in the NHS in 2010 as a Physiotherapist. Her roles have included rotations across many clinical 
specialties but her favourite was always Cardio-Respiratory care. She moved into a research post utilizing digital 
technologies and has experience in managing change implementation including the use of self monitoring technologies 
and virtual services.

### CSC Team Role 
As the Team AI Project manager I support the projects from beginning to end. My role is to facilitate each project 
though our pathway, from refining the projects ideas and goals, the completion of governance documents and the 
evaluation plan when the solution is deployed into the clinical setting.
