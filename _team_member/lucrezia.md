### Bio
Lucrezia joined the CSC team in September 2021. Previously she worked in academia in the field of biomedical computational imaging and AI. Some of her work involved improving the efficiency of quantum technologies through signal processing, but her main project was focused on developing novel non-contact and remote methods to assess cardiovascular health and perform biometric authentication through new hardware design and complementary AI-aided software. 

Lucrezia was the recipient of an NHS HEE Topol Digital Fellowship during which she aims to translate her cardiovascular health detection project from academia to the NHS, showing she is not only capable of writing papers but also putting working prototypes at the service of its intended end users: GPs and cardiologists.


### CSC Team Role
Lucrezia is involved in the development of the AI Deployment Engine (AIDE). She also works on the development of hazen and the CSC website.

Other roles include crafting reports on NHS data standards and overseeing AI evaluation projects.
