---

As part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust support for the [scheme](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/), the Clinical Scientific Computing (CSC) team offers trainees the opportunity to learn more about the use and development of AI in healthcare, including the ethical use of clinical data, to improve patient care and outcomes.

Aside from their work within GSTT, the CSC team is also a core member of the [London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/). This allows STP trainees to learn in a globally unique environment by not only giving them access to the [worldâ€™s largest supercomputer dedicated to healthcare](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/news-and-events/news/helping-build-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-ai-healthcare), but also being an integral part of the entire AI product lifecycle from research and development, to procurement and post-market analysis.

Throughout their time with the team, trainees will gain a variety of transferable skills such as: 

- Software development
- Data curation
- Project management

## How to apply
For more information on how to apply, please refer to the [National School of Healthcare Science (NSHS)](http://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/) Applicants page [here](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/applicants/). Typically, the process consists of three stages:

- Longlisting based on the results of a situational judgement test
- Shortlisting by scientists' review of applications
- Online interviews by employers

As applicants are only able to apply for one specialty, you will need to refer to the [STP Specialisms](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/applicants/stp-specialisms/) available each year. Typically, those interested in working with our team should apply for those within the **[Physical Sciences](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/physical-sciences/)** and **[Informatics](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/)** themes, specifically **[Clinical Scientific Computing](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/clinical-scientific-computing/)**.
